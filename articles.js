            <h4>How I stay committed to learning</h4>

            <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, 
            then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing 
            projects.</p>
        
            <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most 
            things about my journey with the world.</p>
        
            <h4>How I got started</h4>
        
            <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what 
            I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I 
            learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.</p>
        
            <p>That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries
            was also helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>
